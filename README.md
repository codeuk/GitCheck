# GitCheck 🕊
**GitCheck** 🕊 allows you to search through a list of usernames with threading and see if they're available

# Setup ❕
It's very simple: 

    Paste the usernames you would like to check into the 'words.txt' file
    
    Launch 'setup.bat' and wait for everything to install and launch

**The 'hits' (available usernames) will be written to hits.txt**
