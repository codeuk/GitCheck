# GitCheck 🕊
GitCheck 🕊 allows you to scrape through a custom list of usernames and see if they are taken/available
# Setup ❕
The setup is VERY simple:

    Paste the usernames you would like to check into the 'words.txt' file.
    
    Launch 'setup.bat' and wait for everything to complete.
    
    Boom! You've successfully installed & launched Gitcheck!
    
After completing those steps, you should see something similiar to this screen:

*(My available & taken usernames will differ from yours, depending on the usernames you put into words.txt)* 

If you go ahead and check your 'hits.txt' file, you'll see a list of usernames which are available to use on Github!

*Done!*
